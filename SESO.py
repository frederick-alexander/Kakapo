###Current S.E.S.O. Campaign Details
S.E.S.O. is set an alternative history version of the 2014 Crimean conflict. The UN General Assembly Resolution 68/262 superceded the UN Security Council and sent peacekeeping forces to the afflicted region of Bystrica. Thinking it would be a simple operation, three PMCs were contracted for this conflict, one of which is S.E.S.O. The three PMCs work together to attempt to neutralize the Novorossiyan threat until it quickly runs out of control due to poor Ukrainian morale, human rights abuses, and xenophobia. It comes to S.E.S.O. operatives to to shape the outcome of this conflict any way they wish.

#**What is S.E.S.O.?**
S.E.S.O. is a private military group specialized in combined armed assaults, military sabotage, and HVT security. We receive contracts from all sorts of independent entities, supranational organizations, and armed forces.

We emerged as a group of friends with the aim of producing plain fun Zeus missions. That aim has still been true to the this day. We have weekly operations that could range from 3-5 hours. There is no commitment, no sign-up, and no requirements either. Simply download the mods, join the discord, join the teamspeak, and then join the server!
